### Prerequisites

Before we start, here are a few things youâ€™ll need:

- **GitHub Account:** Sign up if you havenâ€™t already [here](https://github.com/).
- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/) to version control your website.
- **Code Editor**: Use a code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Atom.

> *Optional but helpful*: Familiarity with basic HTML, Markdown, or command line usage.

---

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork this repository** to create a copy under your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the repository** to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

   Now youâ€™ll be able to work on your website locally!

### Step 2: Choose a Website Template

You have three main options for building your portfolio. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

1. **HTML5 UP Templates**: These are simple, beautiful HTML templates. Good for custom HTML/CSS.
2. **Jekyll**: A popular static site generator that works well with Markdown and GitHub Pages.
3. **Hugo**: Another static site generator thatâ€™s fast and flexible, especially for complex sites.

> **Note**: HTML5 UP templates provide raw HTML/CSS files, while Jekyll and Hugo generate static pages using Markdown and themes.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Website with HTML5 UP, Jekyll, or Hugo


#### Option A: Wordpress

1. Go to UMassD's word press [server](https://sites.umassd.edu/)
2. Login with your UMassD's credentials.
3. Choose a theme, add content and deploy the website.


#### Option B: HTML5 UP Templates

1. Go to [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) and browse the templates. My [website](https://manasvishal.github.io/) uses [Editorial theme](https://html5up.net/editorial) 
2. Download the template you like, unzip it, and move its contents to your cloned repository.
3. Customize the HTML and CSS to reflect your personal information.


#### Option C: Jekyll

1. Install Jekyll by following [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. Create a new Jekyll site:

   ```bash
   jekyll new my-portfolio
   ```

3. Move your Jekyll site files into your cloned repository folder.
4. Start a local server to preview:

   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

5. Access the site at `http://localhost:4000` to see your progress.

### Step 4: Customize Your Website

Now itâ€™s time to make the website yours! Here are a few things youâ€™ll want to update:

- **Personal Information**: Update your name, photo, bio, and contact information.
- **Research & Publications**: Add sections for your academic work, projects, and publications.
- **Social Media Links**: Add links to your LinkedIn, Twitter, or Google Scholar profiles.

If you're using HTML5 UP, edit the HTML files directly. For Jekyll and Hugo, youâ€™ll generally edit Markdown files in the `content` or `_posts` folders.

---

### Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Once youâ€™re happy with your website, itâ€™s time to deploy!

1. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial website setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch and save.

3. After a few minutes, your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`.

> **Note**: If using Jekyll or Hugo, make sure your `_config.yml` or `config.toml` file is configured correctly for GitHub Pages.
